YIELD
about 4 Belgian-style (deep-pocket) 7" round waffles

Ingredients
		1 1/2 cups (340g) milk, lukewarm
		6 tablespoons (85g) butter, melted
		2 to 3 tablespoons (39g to 57g) maple syrup, optional
		3/4 teaspoon table salt
		1 teaspoon King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract
		2 large eggs
		2 cups (240g) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour
		1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
Instructions
		Combine all of the ingredients in a large bowl, leaving room for expansion; the mixture will bubble and grow.
		Stir to combine; it's OK if the mixture isn't perfectly smooth.
		Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest at room temperature for 1 hour; the mixture will begin to bubble. You can cook the waffles at this point, or refrigerate the batter overnight to cook waffles the next day.
		Preheat your waffle iron. Spray with non-stick vegetable oil spray, and pour 2/3 to 3/4 cup batter (or the amount recommended by the manufacturer) onto the center of the iron. Close the lid and bake for the recommended amount of time, until the waffle is golden brown. It takes us 5 to 6 minutes, using our 7" Belgian-style (deep-pocket) waffle iron.
		Serve immediately, or keep warm in a 200Â°F oven. Serve with berries and whipped cream, if desired.
Tips from our Bakers
		You can choose to prepare the batter for these waffles and cook it after an hour, but we prefer to let the batter rest overnight in the fridge, where it develops some real depth of flavor, yeasty and rich. That said, if you're not a fan of "yeasty," add 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder to the recipe (in addition to the yeast), and cook after just a 30-minute rest; don't refrigerate overnight.
